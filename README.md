# About the Portfolio Project

The main goal of this Portfolio Project is to extract information and data-based conclusions about customers' behavior, with the main theme being the resales aspects. All the analysis is done on public data 'Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset' shared by Ollist, this database can be found in: https://www.kaggle.com/jayeshsalunke101/brazilian-ecommerce-public-dataset?select=olist_geolocation_dataset.csv. 

The project will be updated for the next parts, which will include a Visual Analysis and an Statistical Analysis. 

This is the first part of a project, here are a series of queries done in the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The goal is to organize several tables to perform some statistical and visual analysis to better understand the data we have.
